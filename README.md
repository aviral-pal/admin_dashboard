## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (if using Node.js backend/frontend)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
* [Mention any database specific requirements, e.g., MongoDB Compass, PostgreSQL client]
* [Any other specific dependencies]

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/aviral-pal/admin_dashboard.git](https://github.com/aviral-pal/admin_dashboard.git)
    ```
2.  **Navigate into the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd admin_dashboard
    ```
3.  **Install frontend dependencies (if applicable):**
    ```bash
    cd client # or your frontend directory name
    npm install # or yarn install
    cd ..
    ```
4.  **Install backend dependencies (if applicable):**
    ```bash
    cd server # or your backend directory name
    npm install # or yarn install
    cd ..
    ```
5.  **Configure environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of your project (or specific frontend/backend directories) and add your environment variables.
    ```
    # Example for backend
    PORT=5000
    MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
    JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
    # Add any other necessary environment variables
    ```
    (You might find a `.env.example` file in the repository to guide you.)

### Running the Application

1.  **Start the backend server (if applicable):**
    ```bash
    cd server # or your backend directory name
    npm start # or node server.js (or equivalent command)
    ```
    The backend server will typically run on `http://localhost:[PORT_NUMBER]`.

2.  **Start the frontend development server (if applicable):**
    ```bash
    cd client # or your frontend directory name
    npm start # or yarn start (or equivalent command)
    ```
    The frontend application will typically open in your browser at `http://localhost:[PORT_NUMBER]`.

## Usage

Describe how to use your admin dashboard. Provide screenshots or GIFs if possible.

* **Login:** Access the dashboard via `http://localhost:[FRONTEND_PORT]` and log in with valid credentials.
    * *Default Admin Credentials (if any):*
        * Username: `[E.g., admin]`
        * Password: `[E.g., password]`
* **Navigation:** Explain how to navigate through different sections (e.g., sidebar menu).
* **Performing Actions:** Briefly describe how to perform common tasks (e.g., adding a user, viewing reports).
